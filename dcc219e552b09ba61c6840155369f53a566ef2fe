Perhaps this file should be renamed, \u0027140.install_midolman.sh\u0027.\n\nAlso, I think it\u0027s better if you could separate midolman and midonet API.  It\u0027s possible we mix source and package between them.  This also made me realize that this file should have been \u0027build_midonet\u0027 instead of \u0027build_midolman\u0027 to begin with.",
