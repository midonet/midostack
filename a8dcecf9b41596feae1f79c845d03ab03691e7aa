      "message": "I don\u0027t see a point of have this environment variable if there is a recursive gradle build that builds the submodules, right? It has to be always in the $MIDO_SRC_DEST/python-midonetclient\n\nMoreover, I wouldn\u0027t have the MIDO_SRC_DEST if we already have decided the MIDO_DEST.\n\nIt is ok to have variables, but not one that the user can change. I think this file should be reserved for user-defined vars",

      "message": "I agree with you, this is why MIDO_SRC_DEST and MIDO_CLIENT_SRC_DEST are not settable by users as I mentioned in the comment.  The only thing that should be provided by the users is MIDO_DEST.  What I don\u0027t really want is to have \"MIDO_DEST/midonet/python-midonetclient\" all over the place.  What I was hoping that I achieve are:\n\n1. Make these sub-directories non-settable\n2. Make them available in the rest of the script without needing to hardcode the paths\n\nMaybe there is a better way to do that?",
